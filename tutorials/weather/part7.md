Once we have a proper `WeatherData` object, we're ready to update our text labels. We'll write a dedicated function for this:

```swift
func updateLabels(with data: WeatherData, at location: CLLocation) {
    self.temperature.text = data.temperature
    self.weatherDescription.text = data.description
    self.weatherIcon.text = data.icon
}
```

and we'll call it from where we have the WeatherData:

```swift
if let weatherData = weatherData {
    self.updateLabels(with: weatherData, at: location)
}
```

Now if you run the app and give it a moment to load the forecast, you should see a temperature:

You can also set a custom location in Xcode above the output console. If you go back to the app and press the Refresh button, it should update.

We can improve the UI, though. We can replace the icon label's text with an emoji and reverse-geocode the user's coordinates to get the city name.

### Adding Emoji

Dark Sky gives back a set of icon names. This includes the *clear-day* text in the screenshot above. We can map these icon 
names to emoji using a custom dictionary:

```swift
let emojiIcons = [
    "clear-day" : "‚òÄÔ∏è",
    "clear-night" : "üåô",
    "rain" : "‚òîÔ∏è",
    "snow" : "‚ùÑÔ∏è",
    "sleet" : "üå®",
    "wind" : "üå¨",
    "fog" : "üå´",
    "cloudy" : "‚òÅÔ∏è",
    "partly-cloudy-day" : "üå§",
    "partly-cloudy-night" : "üå•"
]
```

We can access emoji in the dictionary by doing stuff like `emojiIcons["clear-day"]` or `emojiIcons["snow"]`. When we try to access an item that isn't in the dictionary, like `emojiIcons["hurricane"]`, it'll return `nil`. 

Since it can return nil, this is a great place to use the nil-coalescing operator. We can update the icon label by doing `self.weatherIcon.text = emojiIcons[data.icon] ?? "‚ùì"`.

This gives us:

```swift
let emojiIcons = [
    ... //emojis go here
]

func updateLabels(with data: WeatherData) {
    self.temperature.text = data.temperature
    self.weatherDescription.text = data.description
    self.weatherIcon.text = emojiIcons[data.icon] ?? "‚ùì"
}
```

### Reverse Geoencoding

We can also use a CoreLocation function that will look up the city name for a given longitude / latitude pair. The function `CLGeocoder().reverseGeocodeLocation` gives us an optional list of "placemarks" through a completion handler. We can add this at the bottom of our `updateLabels` method:

```swift
CLGeocoder().reverseGeocodeLocation(location) { placemarks, error in
    let locationName = placemarks?.first?.locality ?? "Unknown Location"
    self.weatherLocation.text = locationName
}
```

Now when we run the app again, we see everything works as expected!

If you're having trouble, you can take a look at a copy of the [fully-completed View Controller]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials/weather/part7-finalViewController.md %}).


### And we're all done!

That's everything -- you've built a fully-functional Weather App using CocoaPods, Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, and CoreLocation. All in a day's work!
